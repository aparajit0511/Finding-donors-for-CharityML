# Finding-donors-for-CharityML

Starting the Project
For this assignment, you can find the finding_donors folder containing the necessary project files on the Machine Learning projects GitHub, under the projects folder. You may download all of the files for projects we'll use in this Nanodegree program directly from this repo. Please make sure that you use the most recent version of project files when completing a project!

This project contains three files:

finding_donors.ipynb: This is the main file where you will be performing your work on the project.
census.csv: The project dataset. You'll load this data in the notebook.
visuals.py: This Python script provides supplementary visualizations for the project. Do not modify.
In the Terminal or Command Prompt, navigate to the folder on your machine where you've put the project files, and then use the command jupyter notebook finding_donors.ipynb to open up a browser window or tab to work with your notebook. Alternatively, you can use the command jupyter notebook or ipython notebook and navigate to the notebook file in the browser window that opens. Follow the instructions in the notebook and answer each question presented to successfully complete the project. A README file has also been provided with the project files which may contain additional necessary information or instruction for the project.
